## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was built to imporve my skills with react. I was tasked with creating an app that will allow employees to track the amount of tickets each person has. To create this app I would need to use states and props. 
I also added an extention to the intial project to allow for a new member of the team to be added, so that they can also track the tickets they have. 

This project pushed me to understand why components are useful and should be presentable so that they can be reused. This creates dynamic use throughout the app and using props and containers to do the heavy lifting of functions. 

## ✔️ ToDo <a name="toDo"></a>

- Allow for employees to be searched
- To have the new employee form be a modal

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The use for this project is when you and your team need to track who has tickets they are working on, and also add any extra team members that will be working that day.
